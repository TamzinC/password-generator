# password-generator

## Description

Using my understanding of what I have learnt about the basic fundamentals of Javascript, I have been able to put together a Password Generator. This application runs by taking data from the user and creating a password based upon their responses, such as the password length and what characters they would like to have included. The Javascript code uses a variation of arrays, if statements and for loops within a function to run this application successfully.

Click on 'Generate Password' to get started. You will be prompted to enter how long you would like your password to be. It should look something like this:

Continue following the prompts on the screen and once completed, you should be able to see a random password in the white box on screen that has been put together using your responses.

If you open the console using DevTools (Cmd + Option + J for Mac and Ctrl + Shift + J for Windows), you will be able to see your choices printed out e.g. length chosen and the array of character choices:
